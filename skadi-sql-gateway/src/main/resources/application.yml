# Timestamp/timezone behavior (POC):
# - Columns reported as JDBC TIMESTAMP are advertised as PostgreSQL TIMESTAMP (OID 1114).
# - Columns reported as JDBC TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE are advertised as PostgreSQL TIMESTAMPTZ (OID 1184).
# - Values are currently sent in *text* format using Java's toString() for each cell.
#   If Tableau/JDBC requires ISO-8601 formatting, we'll normalize next.
